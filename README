Eclipse Fleet Tracker
Created by W. Craig Jones - AKA Forceful Peacekeeper / Sciencegeek Deathdealer

Version 2 is a complete rewrite of version 1 due to issues inherent in the design of the system. They began to manifest early in development, and rather than play wack-a-bug, I decided to rewrite with better design in mind.

Folder structure:

/notes - Notes about different topics related to the design.
/ops - Operations that are considered command line, such as first time setup and adding users.
/client - Static files that will be transmitted to the client for processing.
    /client/index.html - The startup page for the client. You don't want to edit this.
    /client/src - Javascript for the client.
    /client/css - CSS for the client
    /client/img - Images for the client.
    /client/tmp - Snippets of HTML for the client.
/server - Files which are related to the server operation at a basic level.
/api - Files for the API that the client hits.
/sql - Files for setting up and maintaining the database.
/bower_components - Client side dependencies.
/node_modules - Server side dependencies.

To start the server, use the "fleet_tool_config.sh" script.

Stack:
    Frontend is Skeleton + jQuery

Security:
    Without an auth token, nothing but the login page can be loaded.
    All API calls must have an accompanying auth token with sufficient permissions.
    For now there are no seperate permission levels.

Development mode:
    Enable development mode by adding the following line to the fleet_tool_config.sh file:
        export DEBUG_AUTH="TRUE"

    Automatic login:
        You need to browse to the website after you start the server, and set your auth token manually.
        Do so by opening the console and running:
            localStorage.setItem("EclipseFleetTrackerAuthToken", "dev-auth-token");

    Dyamic Endpoints:
        You do not need to reload if you update API enpoints.
